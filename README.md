Project Outline:

Project Name: Bill Reminder

Project Description:

My project will be a mobile application that lets users insert a bill amount and description. The application will then remind users the day the bill is due.

Problem Addressing:

The main problem is finiancial information. The mobile applicaiotn user will be able to track their current bills. This will make them aware of the amount and frequency of finiancial bills. Additanal problem is making sure user does not miss the due date of their bills. Missing due dates causes late fees which increase the finicial burder of individuls using the application.

Android Mobile devices


Front/back end Support:

The front support will include areas througthout the applicaiton where user is able to enter a new bill. users will have interactive disapay that is easy to understand and find. Back end support will be java code. The java code will be responsible for handling storage and reminders of all bills.

Functionality:

The user will be alble to navigate though all pages of the applicaion. Ontop of providing an area to enter new bills. A page will include fincial tips to help the user track their spending and finicial goals. Menus will be displayed on the main site to allow for easy navigation. A user login option is avialable so users can create an account that will save their bills so next time the application is accessed all bill will be displayed.
