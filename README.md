Project Outline:
Update: 8/7/2022

Project Name: 
Bill Reminder

Project Description:
My project will be a mobile application that lets users insert a bill amount and description. The application will then remind users the day the bill is due.

Problem Addressing:
The main problem is financial information. The mobile application user will be able to track their current bills. This will make them aware of the amount and frequency of financial bills. Additional problem is making sure user does not miss the due date of their bills. Missing due dates causes late fees which increase the financial burden of individuals using the application.

Platform:
Android Mobile devices

Front/back end Support:
The front support will include areas throughout the application where user is able to enter a new bill. users will have interactive display that is easy to understand and find. Back-end support will be java code. The java code will be responsible for handling storage and reminders of all bills.

Functionality:
The user will be able to navigate though all pages of the application. On top of providing an area to enter new bills. A page will include financial tips to help the user track their spending and financial goals. Menus will be displayed on the main site to allow for easy navigation. A user login option is available so users can create an account that will save their bills so next time the application is accessed all bill will be displayed.

Design:

Main page will include menu to navigate to different pages. The main page will also have a sign in option that will allow past users easy access to their saved bills. The second page will display options to save a new bill with amount and day due. Automatic reminders will be sent to mobile devices alerting users of when the bill date is coming up. The third and last page will be an entire page that includes financial tips for users to read through.
