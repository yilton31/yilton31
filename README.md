Project Outline:

Project Name: 
Bill Reminder

Project Description:
My project will be a mobile application that lets users insert a bill amount, company information, and due date. The application will then remind users the day the bill is due.The application will allow users to easily log in to their account and access their saved bills.

Problem Addressing:
The main problem is financial information. The mobile application user will be able to track their current bills. This will make them aware of the amount and frequency of financial bills. Additional problem is making sure user does not miss the due date of their bills. Missing due dates causes late fees which increase the financial burden of individuals using the application.

Functionality:
The user will be able to navigate though all pages of the application. On top of providing an area to enter new bills. A page will list all current bills which allows them to review spending and financial goals. Menus will be displayed on the main site to allow for easy navigation. A user login option is available so users can create an account that will save their bills so next time the application is accessed all bill will be displayed.

Design:
 Main will allow users to login and submit request for a new password. The Next page will list all bills with amount, company, and due dates. The main page will also have a sign in option that will allow past users easy access to their saved bills. A section of the application will display options to save a new bill with amount and day due. Automatic reminders will be sent to mobile devices alerting users of when the bill date is coming up.
